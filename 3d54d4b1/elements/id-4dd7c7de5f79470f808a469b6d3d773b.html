In the context of VIDA this aggregates all the information which has to be transmited from and to Central VIES aggregating the following information elements:

	- Transaction data
	- Supplier and customer data

Additional information: A coding system in the realm of information technology refers to a standardized method of representing data or information in a format that can be easily understood and processed by computers. It involves the use of a set of rules or protocols to convert information into a form that can be used for various purposes such as data storage, transmission, manipulation, and retrieval.

The coding system is a crucial component of information technology as it enables the efficient and effective communication between different systems and devices. It ensures that the information is accurately and consistently interpreted, regardless of the hardware or software being used.

There are various types of coding systems used in IT, each designed for specific purposes. For instance, the binary coding system is used to represent data in a form that can be directly understood by digital devices. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and Unicode are coding systems used to represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that use text.

Other coding systems include the hexadecimal system used in programming and web design, and the Base64 coding system used to encode binary data, particularly when that data needs to be stored and transferred over media designed to handle text.

In addition, coding systems also play a vital role in data compression, error detection, and correction. They can reduce the amount of space needed to store data and increase the efficiency of data transmission. They can also help detect and correct errors that may occur during data storage and transmission.

In the context of databases, a coding system can also refer to the method used to represent or categorize data. For example, in a healthcare database, a coding system like the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) can be used to represent various diseases and health conditions.

In summary, a coding system is a fundamental element of information technology that enables the efficient and accurate representation, storage, transmission, and manipulation of data. It is a set of rules or protocols that convert information into a form that can be easily understood and processed by computers and other digital devices.

Example: 1. Healthcare Systems: In European healthcare systems, coding systems like the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) are used to categorize and code different diseases and health conditions. This helps in maintaining uniformity in health records across different healthcare providers and facilitates easy sharing and understanding of patient information.

2. Banking and Finance: In the banking and finance sector, coding systems like the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) are used to uniquely identify bank accounts at financial institutions around the world. This helps in facilitating international transactions and ensuring the accuracy and security of financial data.

3. E-commerce: In the e-commerce sector, coding systems like the Universal Product Code (UPC) or European Article Number (EAN) are used to uniquely identify products. This helps in inventory management, tracking of sales, and facilitating transactions.

4. Telecommunications: In telecommunications, coding systems like the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) are used to uniquely identify mobile devices. This helps in tracking and blocking stolen devices, and in the regulation of mobile services.

5. Transportation: In the transportation sector, coding systems like the International Air Transport Association (IATA) codes are used to uniquely identify airports and airlines. This helps in managing flight schedules, tracking flights, and facilitating air travel.

6. Education: In the education sector, coding systems like the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) are used to describe the workload of different courses. This helps in facilitating student mobility and the recognition of qualifications across different European countries.

7. Government Services: In government services, coding systems like the Standard European Trade Classification (SETC) are used to classify different types of goods and services. This helps in maintaining uniformity in trade data, facilitating trade negotiations, and implementing trade policies.
